## Usage

### Arithmetic Operations

Perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:

```python
from math_helper import add, subtract, multiply, divide

print(add(2, 3))  # Output: 5
print(subtract(5, 2))  # Output: 3
print(multiply(3, 4))  # Output: 12
print(divide(10, 2))  # Output: 5
```

### Advanced Operations
```python
from math_helper import factorial

print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
```
